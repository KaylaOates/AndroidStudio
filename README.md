This course covered the software development protocols for wearable and mobile electronics such as head-mounted displays, watches, and cell phones. Several embedded input/output interfaces were studied including, position and orientation sensors, hand trackers, holographic and stereoscopic displays. The students will practice the covered material by developing prototype software applications for such devices.

By the end of this course, I was be able to:

- Obtain a basic understanding of the technologies used in contemporary wearable and mobile devices
- Use the characteristics and design elements required for wearable devices and systems to be widely adopted by the mainstream population for use in everyday life
- Develop software development skills for wearable and mobile devices
